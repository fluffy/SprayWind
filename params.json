An arduino counts the pulses from the anemometer to compute a wind speed. It then uses a Spot Connect device to transmit this wind and temperature information to the web via the globalstar satalite system. This generates and email that drives a django based website. All the code is open source and we look forward to hearing about what other people end up doing with this system.\r\n\r\nThis project was started as an little amusement to do over the holidays and provide information about the weather conditioins at Spray Lakes in ALberta Canada for the the folks that snowkite there. You can see the current data from this station at spraywind.com.  \r\n\r\n## Design \r\n\r\nSome documentation of the design can be found at\r\n(http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/fluffy/SprayWind/blob/master/doc/design.html)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tasks and Bug tracker\r\n\r\nHave a bug or a feature request?
